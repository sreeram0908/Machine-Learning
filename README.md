Machine Learning Assignments

This repository will serve as a collection of my Machine Learning coursework and practice assignments.
The aim is to implement different machine learning algorithms from scratch and using libraries, analyze their performance, and compare results across datasets.

I will be:

Preprocessing and exploring datasets.

Implementing both traditional ML models (Regression, Classification, PLA) and neural networks (MLP).

Performing hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

Evaluating models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.

Comparing results to highlight strengths and limitations of each approach.

This repository will act as a record of my learning progress and experimentation in Machine Learning.
